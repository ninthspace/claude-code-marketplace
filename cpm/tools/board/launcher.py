"""Shell-safe launch command generation (Story 1, epic 39-05).

Textual-free so the security-critical paths are unit-tested directly, without a
Pilot event loop — the same split that made ``board_view`` and ``registry``
testable. A :class:`~status_model.NextAction` and a project root become one of
these launch forms:

- a **clipboard string** — a shell command the user pastes into a terminal, with
  every interpolated path ``shlex.quote()``d;
- a **tmux argv plan** — creates a detached tmux session running that same
  shell-safe command. tmux runs the single command string via its own shell, so
  the exact ``cd … && claude …`` clipboard string is reused verbatim as one argv
  element — no extra escaping layer, and no shell in *our* code (every ``tmux``
  invocation is an argv list).

tmux is the sole launch backend (:func:`select_launch_backend`); where it is
absent the TUI falls back to the clipboard string. No form is ever built by
unescaped string interpolation of a path.

# command is the same ``cd … && claude …`` string the clipboard path uses — tmux
# runs a single trailing command string via its own shell (verified: ``cd … && …``
# chains execute), so no new escaping layer is introduced and shell-safety carries
# over unchanged.
