Inspired by the BMAD-METHOD.\n\n### Three skills forming a pipeline\n\n| Skill | Purpose | Output |\n|-------|---------|--------|\n| `/discover` | Facilitated problem discovery | `docs/planning/brief-{slug}.md` |\n| `/spec` | Requirements & architecture specification | `docs/planning/spec-{slug}.md` |\n| `/stories` | Work breakdown into tracked tasks | Claude Code tasks with dependencies |\n\n### Key features\n\n- Facilitated conversations, not forms — builds on your answers\n- One topic at a time with user-gated progression\n- Scales depth to complexity — skips phases that don''t add value\n- MoSCoW prioritisation for requirements\n- Architecture decisions with rationale and alternatives\n- Right-sized stories with acceptance criteria and dependencies\n\nEach skill works independently or as a pipeline: `/discover` → `/spec` → `/stories` → implement.\nEOF\n\\)\")",
