## Slide 1 — Title
Claude Planning Method (CPM): Structured Planning for Software Development

## Slide 2 — The Challenge
Planning gaps cost time and money. Developers jump from idea to code, conversations get lost, decisions can't be traced.

## Slide 3 — The Solution
CPM fills the planning gap with conversational, structured thinking that produces written documents.

## Slide 4 — The Pipeline (visual flow)
Discover > Brief > Architect > Spec > Epics > Do — each step optional.

## Slide 5 — Flexibility
Scales to the work. Bug fix = skip planning. Big feature = full pipeline.

## Slide 6 — Quality Checks
Review, Retro, and Pivot provide built-in feedback loops.

## Slide 7 — Manager Benefits
Visibility, traceability, knowledge capture, consistency, progress tracking.

## Slide 8 — Differentiation
Facilitates vs prescribes, built-in perspectives, conversational, living documents.

## Slide 9 — Bottom Line
Structured, visible, auditable process. No overhead for simple work, full structure when needed.
