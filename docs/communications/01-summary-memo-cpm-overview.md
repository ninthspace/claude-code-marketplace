CPM is a planning plugin for Claude Code that brings structured thinking to software development. Instead of jumping straight from an idea to writing code, CPM guides teams through understanding the problem, defining the product, making architectural decisions, and breaking work into manageable pieces — all through natural conversation with Claude.

**The problem it solves**: When developers start building before fully understanding what's needed, projects run into scope creep, rework, and misalignment. CPM prevents this by ensuring the right questions get asked at the right time — before code is written, not after.

**How it works**: CPM provides a pipeline of planning skills, each handling a different stage:

- **Discover** — Understand the problem: who has it, why it matters, what success looks like
- **Brief** — Define the product: vision, value propositions, key features
- **Architect** — Make technical decisions: evaluate options, document trade-offs
- **Spec** — Write requirements: prioritised, scoped, with clear boundaries
- **Epics** — Break work down: stories and tasks with acceptance criteria
- **Do** — Execute: work through tasks one by one, verifying each is done correctly
- **Review** — Quality check: multiple perspectives challenge assumptions before work begins

Every step is optional. A simple bug fix needs no planning. A major new feature benefits from the full pipeline. Teams use what fits.

**What makes it different**: CPM facilitates rather than prescribes. It asks questions one at a time, builds on answers, and lets the team make decisions. It also brings diverse perspectives — simulated team roles (PM, architect, designer, QA) weigh in at key moments to surface blind spots.

**Key benefits for managers**:

1. **Visibility** — Planning artifacts are written documents you can read, share, and reference
2. **Consistency** — Every significant feature goes through the same structured thinking
3. **Traceability** — Requirements trace to stories, stories trace to tasks, tasks trace to code
4. **Course correction** — Plans can be amended mid-stream with changes cascading through downstream documents
5. **Knowledge capture** — Decisions and their rationale are recorded, not lost in conversations

**Bottom line**: CPM turns the gap between "we need this feature" and "here's the code" into a structured, visible, auditable process — without adding bureaucracy. It scales to the complexity of the work.
