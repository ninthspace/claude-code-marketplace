# Claude Code Marketplace — Development Guidelines

## Critical: Source vs. Cache Paths

This repository contains the source code for multiple plugins: `cpm`, `noteplan`, `php-lsp`, `sdd`.

**NEVER read or write files in the plugin cache directory** (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/ninthspace-marketplace/`). That directory contains installed copies of plugins and is overwritten on updates. Changes made there are lost and not tracked by git.

**ALWAYS use the source files in this repository.** Each plugin has its own top-level directory:

| Plugin | Source directory |
|--------|----------------|
| CPM | `cpm/` |
| NotePlan | `noteplan/` |
| PHP LSP | `php-lsp/` |
| SDD | `sdd/` |

Common source locations (using CPM as an example — same pattern applies to all plugins):

| What | Source (use this) | Cache (never touch) |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Hook scripts | `cpm/hooks/` | `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../hooks/` |
| Skill files | `cpm/skills/` | `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../skills/` |
| Config files | `cpm/hooks/hooks.json` | `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../hooks/hooks.json` |
| Test suites | `cpm/hooks/tests/` | `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../hooks/tests/` |

When a skill file references relative paths (e.g. `../../agents/roster.yaml`), translate that to the equivalent path under the plugin's source directory in this repo.

If you catch yourself reading from or writing to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, **stop and redirect to the repo source**.

**Exception**: When a skill is actively running (e.g. `/cpm:spec`, `/cpm:do`), it reads its own SKILL.md instructions from the cache — that's normal runtime behaviour. The rule above applies to **development work**: editing hook scripts, skill files, test suites, agent rosters, or any other plugin source code.
